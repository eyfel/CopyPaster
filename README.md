# CopyPaster2
This application is designed to streamline the workflow for users who often find themselves needing to copy specific information from areas on their screen where direct text selection and copying are not possible. It automates the process of identifying text within a specified screen area through Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and then matches this identified text against a predefined list of identifiers (IDs). When a match is found, the corresponding value to that ID is copied to the user's clipboard, ready to be pasted wherever needed. This automation tool is particularly useful in scenarios like document processing, data entry tasks, or when working with software that does not allow text selection.

The script uses pytesseract, a Python wrapper for Google's Tesseract-OCR Engine, to recognize text from images. This requires taking a screenshot of a predetermined region on the screen, which is handled by the pyautogui library. The script is activated by a mouse click, specifically looking for left-click actions to trigger the screenshot and OCR process. This region can be adjusted to target the specific area where the desired text is located.

Once the text is captured and recognized, it is matched against the copy_list, a collection of dictionaries where each dictionary contains a copy_id (the identifier) and a copy_value (the corresponding value that should be copied to the clipboard). The matching process involves regular expressions (regex) to ensure precise identification, taking into account possible variations in the recognized text due to OCR inaccuracies or special characters. The script has been enhanced to handle Turkish characters by substituting them with a dot (.) in the regex pattern, broadening the script's applicability to non-English text environments.

Upon finding a match, the script uses pyperclip to copy the associated value to the clipboard. It also updates a graphical user interface (GUI), built with Tkinter, to inform the user of the copied ID. This GUI is designed to be minimalistic, providing immediate, clear feedback without disrupting the user's workflow. It includes functionality to keep the window always on top, ensuring visibility.

The application runs in a background thread for the GUI, allowing the main script to listen for mouse clicks without freezing the user interface. This multithreading approach ensures that the application remains responsive and that the GUI can be updated in real-time.

This tool is an excellent example of leveraging Python's powerful libraries to create practical, user-friendly applications that automate repetitive tasks, enhancing efficiency and accuracy. Whether used for personal productivity hacks or integrated into professional workflows, this script demonstrates the potential of automation in everyday computing tasks.
